	abstract = {We prove {NP}-hardness results for five of Nintendo's largest video game franchises: Mario, Donkey Kong, Legend of Zelda, Metroid, and Pokemon. Our results apply to generalized versions of Super Mario Bros. 1-3, The Lost Levels, and Super Mario World; Donkey Kong Country 1-3; all Legend of Zelda games; all Metroid games; and all Pokemon role-playing games. In addition, we prove {PSPACE}-completeness of the Donkey Kong Country games and several Legend of Zelda games.},

	title = {{PushPush} and Push-1 are {NP}-hard in 2D},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0007021},
	abstract = {We prove that two pushing-blocks puzzles are intractable in 2D. One of our constructions improves an earlier result that established intractability in 3D [{OS}99] for a puzzle inspired by the game {PushPush}. The second construction answers a question we raised in [{DDO}00] for a variant we call Push-1. Both puzzles consist of unit square blocks on an integer lattice; all blocks are movable. An agent may push blocks (but never pull them) in attempting to move between given start and goal positions. In the {PushPush} version, the agent can only push one block at a time, and moreover when a block is pushed it slides the maximal extent of its free range. In the Push-1 version, the agent can only push one block one square at a time, the minimal extent---one square. Both {NP}-hardness proofs are by reduction from {SAT}, and rely on a common construction.},
